# The path algebra of a quiver

The path algebra `kQ` of a quiver `Q` over a semiring `k` is the free `k`-module on the paths of
`Q`, with the product of two paths their concatenation when they are composable and `0` otherwise.

Paths are concatenated in the *later factor first* order: for `p : Path a b` and `q : Path c a`,
the product of the corresponding basis elements is the basis element of `q.comp p : Path c b`.
With this convention an arrow `α : i ⟶ j` satisfies `eⱼ * α = α = α * eᵢ` for the vertex
idempotents `e`, so left multiplication by `α` carries the `i`-component of a left module to its
`j`-component: representations of `Q` are left `kQ`-modules.

## Main definitions

* `OpConjecture.Foundation.Quiver.TotalPath Q`: the total space `Σ a b, Path a b` of the paths of `Q`, the index
  type of the path basis.
* `OpConjecture.Foundation.Quiver.TotalPath.mul?`: concatenation of two indexed paths, `none` when they are not
  composable.
* `OpConjecture.Foundation.pathAlgebra k Q`: the path algebra, with `OpConjecture.Foundation.PathAlgebra.single` its basis
  elements. It is a non-unital semiring for any quiver, and carries `Semiring`, `Ring` and
  `Algebra k` structures once the vertex type is `Finite`, finiteness being what makes the unit
  `1 = ∑ᵥ eᵥ` exist.
* `OpConjecture.Foundation.PathAlgebra.vertexIdempotent`: the idempotent `eᵥ` given by the trivial path at `v`.
* `OpConjecture.Foundation.pathAlgebraBasis`: the paths of `Q` as a `k`-basis of `kQ`.
* `OpConjecture.Foundation.Quiver.OneLoop`: the quiver with one vertex and one loop.

## Main results

* `OpConjecture.Foundation.PathAlgebra.single_mul_single`: the defining product of two basis paths.
* `OpConjecture.Foundation.PathAlgebra.one_def`: the vertex idempotents sum to `1`; they are
  orthogonal by `OpConjecture.Foundation.PathAlgebra.vertexIdempotent_mul_vertexIdempotent_of_ne`.
* `OpConjecture.Foundation.module_finite_pathAlgebra` and `OpConjecture.Foundation.finrank_pathAlgebra`: `kQ` is a free module of
  rank the number of paths of `Q`. The specialization to a finite acyclic quiver, whose paths are
  finite, is `OpConjecture.Foundation.finiteDimensional_pathAlgebra_of_isAcyclic` in
  `OpConjecture.Foundation.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Acyclic.PathAlgebra`.
* `OpConjecture.Foundation.PathAlgebra.adjoin_vertexIdempotents_union_arrows`: the vertex idempotents and arrows
  generate the path algebra.
* `OpConjecture.Foundation.PathAlgebra.oneLoopAlgEquiv`: the one-loop path algebra is the additive monoid algebra
  on `ℕ`; `OpConjecture.Foundation.not_finiteDimensional_pathAlgebra_oneLoop` records that it is
  infinite-dimensional.

## Implementation notes

`pathAlgebra k Q` is a semireducible type synonym for `Quiver.TotalPath Q →₀ k`, following the
pattern of `MonoidAlgebra`: were it reducible, instance search would unfold it and pick up the
*pointwise* multiplication of `Finsupp`. The multiplication is therefore introduced as an
operation `mul'` on `Quiver.TotalPath Q →₀ k` (with `singleOption` naming the product of two basis
paths, which is a basis path or `0`), where the `Finsupp` API applies without friction; the ring
axioms are proved there and transferred definitionally.

That whole layer is private. The exposed `Mul` instance spells out the same operation because it
cannot mention a private declaration; `mul_def` records their definitional agreement. The ring
axioms reach the structure instances through a `by exact` for the same reason. `pathAlgebra` is the
only definition whose body is `@[expose]`d, because the transported instances unfold it; every other
definition here is opaque downstream, which sees the path algebra through its algebraic structure
and the lemmas below
(`ofPath_eq_single` and `vertexIdempotent_eq_single` for the basis elements, `single_mul_single`
and the `mul?` lemmas for products) rather than through the `Finsupp` representation.

Since `Finset.univ` is data, the unit is the sum of the vertex idempotents over a `Fintype`
structure chosen internally by `Fintype.ofFinite`; the unital instances therefore ask only for
`[Finite Q]`, and `one_def` identifies `1` with the sum over *any* `Fintype Q` a caller supplies.
